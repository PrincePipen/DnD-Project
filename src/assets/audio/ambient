The directory `/dnd-project/dnd-project/src/assets/audio/ambient` is intended to hold ambient sound files to enhance the game's atmosphere. Since this is a directory, it does not contain any files by default. You can add audio files (e.g., `.mp3`, `.wav`) to this directory as needed for your project.

This directory is intentionally left blank.
